Any suggestions from the attendees are warmly welcome 
(both for the topics and examples) 
as the course is intended to be as interactive as possible.

It would also be very useful to know whether you know other programming languages, which ones and how well (1-5). 
So I can explain (hopefully) new concepts in terms of other programming languages you are familiar with.

## NOT Contents 
- This course is not about how to setup Python and the other needed modules on your system. 
The process is usually quite easy but might be very system-dependent and it is not related to the language itself. 

I strongly suggest you to use 
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
for this course as I will be using it too. 
I prepared this 
[jupyter](https://jupyter.org) 
[notebook](https://github.com/mbarnaba/python3/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) 
for the course and my idea would be to expand it together. 

In case you do not like Google, there are other solutions for running 
[jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks in your browser, 
e.g., [alternatives](https://www.dataschool.io/cloud-services-for-jupyter-notebook). 
I did test them, so do not ask me in case something is not right with them, sorry ;)
